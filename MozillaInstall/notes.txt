Created this directory so I could try installing onto a Firefox OS Device. The install-ff-os.html works in a Mozilla browser (OS Simulator or device). The /tw directory is a relative path on my site, the manifest also has to have the correct path. THe .htaccess is required to serve the manifext file.
