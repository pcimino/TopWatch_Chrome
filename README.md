Chrome Web Store manifest files and icons for Google's online store.

# [Enyo Tutorial Part III ???](http://pcimino.blog.com/enyo/)

A bit of a detour from the main tutorial. I thought I'd quickly create the files I need to host the app online and have it appear in the Chrome Web Store. The create the files in this package [follow these steps](https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/get_started_simple#step2).

Chrome basically points to a hosted app, [in this case, here](http://translunardesigns.com/tw/index.html).

# Mozilla Firefox OS
To install onto a Firefox OS device, navigate to [http://translunardesigns.com/install-ff-os.html](http://translunardesigns.com/install-ff-os.html)

This is really for demonstration only, the stop watch dial does not size correctly on the device or simulator that I tested.
